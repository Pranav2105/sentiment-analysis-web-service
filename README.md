Sentiment Analysis Web Service with Docker and Kubernetes
This project demonstrates the deployment of a simple Sentiment Analysis model as a web service using Docker and Kubernetes. The service predicts the sentiment of input text data and logs the predictions into a MySQL database.

Bonus Features
1. AI Model Development
The sentiment analysis model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained to predict sentiment based on input text data.

2. Web Service Creation
A Flask web service is created to serve the sentiment analysis model. The service exposes an API endpoint (/predict) where users can submit text data and receive sentiment predictions. Predictions are logged in a MySQL database.

3. Containerization with Docker
The AI model and web service are containerized using Docker. The Dockerfile specifies the environment, dependencies, and how the application should run.

4. Deployment with Kubernetes
Kubernetes is used for managing the deployment of Docker containers. The deployment.yaml file defines the deployment configuration, including scaling and managing the application.

5. Documentation
Prerequisites
Docker installed: Get Docker
Kubernetes installed: Install Kubernetes
MySQL server installed: Install MySQL
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-web-service.git
cd sentiment-analysis-web-service
Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t your-docker-image:tag .
Push the Docker image to a container registry (if needed).

Apply the Kubernetes deployment:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Apply the Kubernetes service:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
Access the deployed web service at http://your-cluster-ip:80/predict.

6. Bonus (Optional)
API Authentication: Add basic authentication to the API for enhanced security.
Front-end Interface: Implement a simple front-end interface for user interaction with the model.
